# Hazel and Hamsika's Mini NEA

## Ideas:
 - Fireboy Watergirl but movements are through some sort of face movements, eg. your nose moving)

 * Cast spells/attacks using hand movements.

 + Quickdraw w/ Google but your hand draws

## Idea we chose: 

### Cast spells/attacks using hand movements.

### You can cast spells using hand gestures

Kinda like rock, paper, scissors; but instead of those its:
  - Fire
  * Water

  * Earth
  + Air


## Analysis
### The Problem:
People want more engaging games and need more entertainment, we're gonna solve the problem by making an interactive game

### Stakeholders:
Our stakeholders will be other people in class, they will be involved through training our module as well.

### Research:
1. Divineko

### Features:

1. a rock paper scissors style game to decide who gets attacked (the person who loses)

2. two types of games (group (rps) or fighting each other ())

3. A timer for movements to happen (so both players play at once)

## Design

### Structure:

We first plan to make the FWEA game and use different people to do the 'poses' so that our algorithm is trained on different places and scenes. We're gonna do it like this because that is the main game and is used in both styles of game.
